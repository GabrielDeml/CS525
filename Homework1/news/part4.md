# Future Work

The following is a list of things that could be done to improve the quality of the results:
* Do fact checking
* Use BERT


BERT could be used to improve the quality of the results. It would give a better understanding of the context of the word snippet. Other people have successfully been able to use BERT for fake news detection. 

We could use BERT for better detection of fake news. 

The simplest way I see to improve the results is to use an LSTM model. Right now we are just using relatively simple classification models. An LSTM model would allow us to use the context of the sentence to better understand the meaning. An LSTM model is just a more advanced model so I think it would give better accuracy.
